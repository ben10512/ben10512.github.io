		<p class="focusPoint">What makes me tick?</p>
		<p> I love all forms of technology, but I certainly have other interests. When I'm not working in a classroom or studying, 
		I love to be outside, and often times, I'm miles from the nearest road. I have a deep passion for the outdoors, and I love to unplug 
		and explore different parts of this beautiful world. I'm not particular in my means of getting into the woods. I downhill ski, 
		rock climb, backpack, canoe/kayak, and enjoy my newest hobby - trail running. My favorite places include the Adirondacks in 
		upstate New York, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota, Shenandoah National Park, and any steep, snow-covered hill in Vail, Colorado.
		<br> <br>
		While exploring the backcountry, I often take my camera along with me and enjoy capturing  the beauty that I see on my travels. 
		I am also interested in video camera work and have been able to gain experience while assisting with several video productions 
		for friends and even a few professional corporate shoots. This interest started during high school when I became a trusted member 
		of the audio-visual team at my church. Over the years since that time, I have often been asked to run sound or video for services, 
		funerals, weddings, conferences, and even special large productions for upwards of 600 people.
		<br><br>
		My interest in sound technology and attention to detail led me to be involved in researching and purchasing new sound equipment 
		for the church. I was asked to assist in training fellow volunteers on the new equipment. My experience with the sound system at 
		church has given me an opportunity to explore my entrepreneurial streak, and I have had the privilege to be hired as a sound tech 
		by some local bands.
