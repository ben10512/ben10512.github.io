				<h1>Thanks for visiting! </h1>
				<p>Welcome! I'm a graduating senior from Towson University who is excited to be entering into the 
				marketplace with a focus on System Administration, Network Engineering, and Web Development.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>Thanks for stopping by my website. Please	take a look around and get to know me better. If you'd like to

				<h1 class="text-center">Ben Deibert: </h1>
				<p>I love all forms of technology, but I certainly have other interests. When I'm not working in a classroom or studying, 
				I love to be outside, and often times, I'm miles from the nearest road. I have a deep passion for the outdoors, and I love to unplug 
				and explore different parts of this beautiful world. I'm not particular in my means of getting into the woods. I downhill ski, 
				rock climb, backpack, canoe/kayak, and enjoy my newest hobby - trail running. My favorite places include the Adirondacks in 
				upstate New York, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota, Shenandoah National Park, and any steep, snow-covered hill in Vail, Colorado.</p>
				<p>While exploring the backcountry, I often take my camera along with me and enjoy capturing  the beauty that I see on my travels. 
				I am also interested in video camera work and have been able to gain experience while assisting with several video productions 
				for friends and even a few professional corporate shoots. This interest started during high school when I became a trusted member 
				of the audio-visual team at my church. Over the years since that time, I have often been asked to run sound or video for services, 
				funerals, weddings, conferences, and even special large productions for upwards of 600 people.</p>
				<p>My interest in sound technology and attention to detail led me to be involved in researching and purchasing new sound equipment 
				for the church. I was asked to assist in training fellow volunteers on the new equipment. My experience with the sound system at 
				church has given me an opportunity to explore my entrepreneurial streak, and I have had the privilege to be hired as a sound tech 
				by some local bands. </p>

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<h4>Towson</h4>
				<p>I am currently in my senior year at Towson University having transferred here my junior year. I am pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree 
				in Information Technology. While at Towson, I have taken several interesting classes: Linux system administration, computer 
				networking, information security, web development, and disaster recovery and enterprise continuity. These courses and others have 
				helped me refine my passion for professional technical operations.</p>
				<p>I am looking forward to graduating in the spring and applying the knowledge I've learned in the real working world. I hope 
				to hear from you and share how I can benefit your team.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Past Employers</h2>
				<h4>Hemlock Wilderness Brigade Camp</h4>
				<p>Over the past seven years, I have been heavily involved with this organization. I am a member of the Board of Directors, 
				and over the past four summers, I have worked on the senior leadership team throughout the summer. My duties included leading 
				two three-week-long intensive leadership and staff development programs. Those summers required me to handle many 
				responsibilities, lead through many diverse situations, and facilitate the day-to-day camp operations.</p>
				<p>This past summer I was responsible for training and monitoring 20-25 junior staff members and helping 30-60 campers experience 
				a great week at camp. With my team of senior leaders, I oversaw and challenged the members of staff to run a fun, efficient, 
				and safe camp.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Apple Inc.</h4>
				<p>After graduating high school, I joined Apple retail. A few months later, I was asked to join the retail business team. 
				Throughout my time with the business team, I developed long term relationships with customers, took the lead on projects, 
				and helped with large projects and custom deployments.</p>
				<p>I enjoyed working with the cutting edge technology and explaining how customers could incorporate the tools into their daily 
				life and business world. The challenge of learning on the fly and presenting that excitement to customers was very exciting.</p>

				<h1 class="text-center">Aspirations:</h1>
				<h2>Where from here?</h2>
				<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed my education thus far and have also loved my retail experience, but I can't wait to join the real 
				working world. I am looking forward to joining a company where I can use my skills, continue to refine my knowledge, and grow 
				into a real asset and benefit to an organization.</p>
				<p>I have really enjoyed my Linux system administration course, and I find computer networks fascinating. I would love to work in 
				a large scale environment where I can apply my current system administration and computer network knowledge and learn day-to-day 
				operations and long term system integrity.</p>
				<h2>Longterm Goals</h2>
				<p>As I continue to gain real world experience, I would be very interested in pursuing a master’s degree. Additionally, 
		I would readily consider growing into a System Architecture position. I took a disaster recovery and enterprise continuity 
		course while at Towson. I am very interested in how I can incorporate that focus into my future career.</p>
