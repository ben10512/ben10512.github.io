		<p class="focusPoint">Where from here?</p>
		<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed my education thus far and have also loved my retail experience, but I can't wait to join the real 
		working world. I am looking forward to joining a company where I can use my skills, continue to refine my knowledge, and grow 
		into a real asset and benefit to an organization. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I have really enjoyed my Linux system administration course, and I find computer networks fascinating. I would love to work in 
		a large scale environment where I can apply my current system administration and computer network knowledge and learn day-to-day 
		operations and long term system integrity. 
		</p>

		<p class="focusPoint">Longterm Goals</p>
		<p>As I continue to gain real world experience, I would be very interested in pursuing a masterâ€™s degree. Additionally, 
		I would readily consider growing into a System Architecture position. I took a disaster recovery and enterprise continuity 
		course while at Towson. I am very interested in how I can incorporate that focus into my future career.
