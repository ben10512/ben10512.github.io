		<p class="titleHeading">Towson University:</p>
		<p>I am currently in my senior year at Towson University having transferred here my junior year. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree 
		in Information Technology. While at Towson, I have taken several interesting classes: Linux system administration, computer 
		networking, information security, web development, and disaster recovery and enterprise continuity. These courses and others have 
		helped me refine my passion for professional technical operations. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I am looking forward to graduating in the spring and applying the knowledge I've learned in the real working world. I hope 
		to hear from you and share how I can benefit your team. 
		</p>

		<p class="titleHeading">Anne Arundel Community College:</p>
		<p>I attended Anne Arundel Community College for the first few years of my college education. I focused on general 
		studies and specifically the classes that I could transfer to a four year institution.

		<p class="titleHeading">Hemlock Wilderness Brigade Camp:	</p>
		<p>Over the past seven years, I have been heavily involved with this organization. I am a member of the Board of Directors, 
		and over the past four summers, I have worked on the senior leadership team throughout the summer. My duties included leading 
		two three-week-long intensive leadership and staff development programs. Those summers required me to handle many 
		responsibilities, lead through many diverse situations, and facilitate the day-to-day camp operations. 
		<br>
		<br>
		This past summer I was responsible for training and monitoring 20-25 junior staff members and helping 30-60 campers experience 
		a great week at camp. With my team of senior leaders, I oversaw and challenged the members of staff to run a fun, efficient, 
		and safe camp.

		<br>
		<p class="titleHeading">Apple Inc.:</p>
		<p>After graduating high school, I joined Apple retail. A few months later, I was asked to join the retail business team. 
		Throughout my time with the business team, I developed long term relationships with customers, took the lead on projects, 
		and helped with large projects and custom deployments. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I enjoyed working with the cutting edge technology and explaining how customers could incorporate the tools into their daily 
		life and business world. The challenge of learning on the fly and presenting that excitement to customers was very exciting.
